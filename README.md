# Tree-Designer

**[2024.05]** Recently, we also have a paper published in ACM CHI which leveraged AI to create more natural branching structures. Please check [this repository](https://github.com/RyuZhihao123/CHITreeProject). But if you want to design 3D trees directly on your Windows PC, this current repository would be a better fit (since it's not AI-based and easy to configure on PC).

**[2017.10]** This is a sketch based tree modeling software, implemented with C++ and OpenGL. We released the binary program.

**I made it when I was a third-year undergraduate student (2017).** If you are using Win10+, you can directly use my software without any configuration.


### 1. SOFTWARE

- ðŸ“º **Demo Video**: Please first watch this **[[Demo Video]](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DacX4doX6oevivpZYOWCYfSVtomccKgG/view?usp=sharing)** for the instructions on the usage of this software.
- ðŸ”´ **Download Link of My Software**: Please download the entire **[[Folder]](https://github.com/RyuZhihao123/TreeDesigner/tree/master/SketchTree_exe_Zhihao)**.

- ðŸŸ¢ **Usage:** After downloading the full directory, double click the **``SketchBasedTreeModeling.exe``** to start our program. The program is only complied on **Win10+**. Mac is currently NOT supported. **No further configuration is required.** Below is the four steps you need to perform to create 3D tree models:

    - Step1: **Left Mouse Button** to draw the tree sketches.
    - Step2: **CTRL+LeftButton** to choose the Root position.
    - Step3: **ALT+LeftButton** to select the Foliage area.
    - Step4: Sequentially press the **four red buttons (1~4)** at the bottom-right corner to generate the final 3D tree model.

- ðŸŸ£ **Customized Textures:** If you want to use your own external Leaf/Branch Textures, you could simply put the figures (PNG format) under the following paths, respectively:
  - PATH TO LEAVES: ``./SketchTree_exe_Zhihao/leaves/``
  - PATH TO BARKS: ``./SketchTree_exe_Zhihao/barks/``


You can freely use my program but please at least mention my name ^_^.
